API Name: Batch get companies by ID
Function: Pass in a list of company IDs or URNs, and get back a full picture of those companies.
Note:
If a company ID is -1, that we means we don't yet have a canonical company record for that company.
The API will not return data for these companies.

This is because we take snapshot of a company every 14 days but we might update the live state of company before that.
